# ROBOTIC-HAND-CONTROLLED-BY-HAND-GESTURE-SYSTEM
This robotic hand uses flex sensors on a glove to record hand gestures. An Arduino processes these resistance changes through a voltage divider circuit to control servo motors proportionally. Designed for precision in unsafe environments, it bridges human movement with digital robotics.
